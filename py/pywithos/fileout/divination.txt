2 Corithian 11:14
13 Those men are false missionaries.
They lie about their work.
But they make themselves look like true missionaries of Christ.
14 It is no surprise! The devil makes himself look like an angel of light.
15 And so it is no surprise if his servants also make themselves look like preachers of the Good News.
They and their work will come to the same end.

Deuteronomy 18:10-11
Occult Practices
9 When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
10 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire,
who practices divination or sorcery,
interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 11 or casts spells,
or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.
12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord;
because of these same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.
13 You must be blameless before the Lord your God.

Acts 16:16
Paul and Silas in Prison
16 As we were going to the place of prayer,
we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
17 She followed Paul and us, crying out,
“These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.”
18 And this she kept doing for many days.
Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.”
And it came out that very hour.
19 But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone,
they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
20 And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
21 They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice.”
22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
24 Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
