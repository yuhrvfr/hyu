#10 Branch even-better-feature add this text
Don't forget to commit this change

#Step conflicting this text is in main-branch
#Step conflicting: this text is in even-better-branch

#11 After using atom to resolved the conflict, use git status to show what to do:

a) Resolved the code conflict
b) $ git add <file where code is resolved>
c) $ git commit -m "There will a default message about conflict resolution and I can add some additional comments "
Be carefull the merge will be only in main branch, for even-better branch additional steps required.
If I check with git log -p I can see tThanks he HEAD is ONLY pointing to the commit of main branch.

The merge from branch even-better-feature is in main branch, BUT the code of main branch is NOT in even-better branch.

To synchronize both branch.
$ git checkout even-better-feature
$ git merge main

Now both branches are in sync.
